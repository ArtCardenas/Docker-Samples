# Multi Containers App

This is a repo for new users getting started with Docker.

We are going to run this application with the docker compose up command in your project directory.
This command builds and runs all the services listed in the compose file.

You can try it out using the following command.

```docker compose up -d```

The -d flag tells docker compose to run in detached mode.

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
